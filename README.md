## Built With ##
Html, JavaScript, and CSS - nothing but the basics!

## About ##
This app was made just for fun as an exploration of CSS. After getting into creating CSS art, (which you can find [here](https://codepen.io/collection/XWmPNK)) I wanted to build something more fleshed out that focused on CSS.

## Future Updates ##
I do plan to add facial expressions, accessories, and more hair styles in the future.
